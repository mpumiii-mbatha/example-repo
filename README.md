## Introduction
This programme has two lists with questions and punchlines that make up one joke.
Each joke is sourced from https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a63383080/funny-jokes/
The lists are combined together using the zip function, and the random module is then used to select randomly from the paired lists. 
Each time you run the programme, it prints a random joke from the paired list of jokes.
